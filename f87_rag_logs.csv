2025-05-16 04:19:15,v1.1,What suspension components are recommend to upgrade especially for heavy track use?,"For heavy track use, consider upgrading the following suspension components:

1. **Coilovers**: Upgrading to a high-quality coilover system can significantly improve cornering and handling on the track. Look for ones that offer adjustability to fine-tune your setup based on track conditions and driving style.

2. **Camber Plates**: Installing camber plates will allow you to adjust the camber angle to improve tire contact with the road during high-speed cornering, enhancing grip and stability.

3. **Monoball Conversion for Thrust Arm**: This upgrade can increase steering feel and reduce the slop associated with OEM bushings, providing a more direct and responsive handling experience.

4. **Differential Lift Kits**: Particularly if you lower your car, a diff lift kit can help restore axle angles and improve the longevity of the axles, which is crucial for maintaining performance and durability under track conditions.

5. **Suspension Arms Upgrade**: Upgrading to stronger arms with better bushings can restore geometry, reduce slop, and add strength, which is beneficial for handling precision and reliability during intense track use.

2025-05-16 04:20:15,v1.1,What are some recommended camber plates?,"For your BMW M2, here are some recommended camber plates based on user experiences from the Bimmerpost F87 M2 forums:

1. **Ground Control Camber Plates**: Users have reported good experiences with these, noting better tire wear and the ability to achieve around -2.8 degrees of camber. They are compatible with stock suspension, and while some users mention noise, others have not found it to be a significant issue.

2. **Vorshlag Camber Plates**: These are another popular choice among M2 owners. They are noted for their quality and the ability to provide significant camber adjustments. Users have mentioned that Vorshlag's instructions may recommend using impact tools for installation, which can be a point of confusion but generally leads to successful setup.

3. **Millway Camber Plates**: These are well-regarded for street use with stock dampers, offering good adjustability and minimal noise or complaints. They are a great upgrade if you're looking for a balance between performance and comfort.

Each of these options has been tested and reviewed by fellow M2 owners on the forums, providing real-world feedback on their performance and suitability for both track and street use.","Does anyone know what the OEM camber specs are?

2025-05-16 04:21:03,v1.1,What is a B Street setup?,"For a competitive B Street setup on a BMW M2 Competition, you might consider the following modifications based on recommendations from the Bimmerpost F87 M2 forums:

1. **Tires**: Opt for a staggered setup with 265/285 RE-71Rs on stock sized Forgelines. Once those tires wear out, switching to 255/275 A052s could be a good move, as they are well-suited for camber-limited stock cars.

2. **Suspension**: While you already have an H&R front sway bar, adding adjustable components like a Whiteline adjustable front bar can further enhance handling. Consider also exploring options like the MCS Single Adjustable Damper Set for more precise control and adjustability.

3. **Wheels**: Running a square setup with 275/18 tires has been a popular choice among enthusiasts for maintaining balance and grip.

4. **Brakes**: If you are dealing with limitations due to the 2NH brakes and can't run 18"" wheels, sticking with 19"" wheels is necessary. For brake pads, using a combination like Ferodo DS2500 on the street and DS1.11 on the track can offer a good balance between street and track use without requiring bed-in when switching pads.

These components are tailored to enhance the performance of the M2 Competition in B Street class autocross events, focusing on maintaining a balance between competitive edge and compliance with class regulations.","Hi All,Just wondering for some B-street setup for BMW M2 Competition.

2025-05-15 21:28:43,v1.1,What are some recommendations for upgrading the suspension control arms and bushings for track use?,"For upgrading the suspension control arms and bushings for track use on your M2, here are some recommendations based on the forum discussions:

1. **Control Arms**: Upgrading to aftermarket control arms like SPL can restore geometry, add strength, and reduce the slop of the OEM bushings. However, consider that these might introduce more noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) into the ride. They are generally recommended if you are committed to frequent track use.

2. **Bushings**: Replacing the front rubber bushing on the thrust arm with a monoball conversion can provide more precise feedback and reduce slop. This upgrade is particularly beneficial for track-oriented handling as it enhances the feel and response of the suspension system.

3. **Camber Plates**: While you mentioned camber plates primarily, it's worth noting that they allow for regular and significant adjustments to camber settings, which can be beneficial for both street and track settings. They can be easily adjusted to switch between settings for different uses.

4. **Tension Arms**: If you're looking to further refine your setup, consider upgrading the tension arms. These can help adjust caster and further fine-tune the handling characteristics of your M2, especially in reducing tire rub and allowing more aggressive camber settings without interference.

5. **Additional Considerations**: Depending on how much you lower the car and the changes in suspension geometry, you might also need to look into sway bar end links and possibly other alignment components to ensure everything works harmoniously.

These upgrades can significantly improve the handling characteristics of your M2 on the track while maintaining reasonable street usability. Remember to balance these upgrades with considerations for ride quality and component wear, especially if the vehicle is also used daily on public roads.","Hi all, I'm fairly new in the world of suspensions and would like to know what the benefits are of say getting an aftermarket control arm and tie rods such as SPL?

2025-05-15 21:36:10,v1.1,Do you have steps for installing the rear toe arms?,"To install the rear toe arms on your M2, follow these general steps:

1. **Lift and Support the Vehicle**: Safely lift the vehicle and support it on jack stands to ensure it is stable.

2. **Remove the Wheels**: Remove the rear wheels to access the toe arms.

3. **Remove Existing Toe Arms**: Locate the toe arms and remove the bolts that hold them in place. You may need to use a wrench or socket set to loosen and remove these bolts.

4. **Install New Toe Arms**: Position the new toe arms in place where the old ones were removed. Secure them with the provided bolts. If your new toe arms come with specific torque specifications, use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts to these specifications.

5. **Check Alignment and Adjustments**: Once the new toe arms are installed, it's crucial to check the alignment. You may need to make adjustments to ensure the wheels are properly aligned. This step is best done at a professional alignment shop, especially if you're not experienced with suspension work.

6. **Reinstall the Wheels**: Once everything is in place and properly tightened, reinstall the wheels.

7. **Lower the Vehicle**: Carefully lower the vehicle from the jack stands and remove the lifting equipment.

8. **Test Drive**: Take a test drive to ensure everything is working correctly and that the vehicle's handling feels stable and as expected.

These steps provide a general guideline. Always refer to the specific installation instructions provided with your toe arms, as there may be additional steps or specific procedures recommended by the manufacturer.","Has anyone upgraded to toe arms w steel bushings i.e. the turner toe arms?I wonder how much nvh they increase into the body.I think the rear toe has a significant amount of flex that causes the car to waddle a bit on hard acceleration...

If the car is used for track days or driven hard, more frequent changes (e.g., every 3,000 to 6,000 miles) are suggested.

1. **Forged crankshaft** and **forged connecting rods** - These components provide increased strength and durability, which are crucial for handling the stresses of high-speed driving.

2. **M3/M4 pistons** and **cast-iron sleeves** - These enhance the engine's ability to withstand higher pressures and temperatures, contributing to its robustness during extended high-speed runs.

3. **Better oil cooling** - This feature is essential for maintaining optimal engine temperature and lubrication, especially important at sustained high speeds to prevent overheating and ensure smooth engine operation.

4. **S55 oil pump and baffle system** - These components help in maintaining proper oil circulation and pressure, crucial for engine health during dynamic driving conditions like those experienced at high speeds.

2025-05-16 20:43:58,v1.1,How do I remove a coil over?,"To remove a coilover, follow these steps:

1. **Safety First**: Ensure the car is securely lifted and supported on jack stands. Never work under a car supported only by a jack.

2. **Wheel Removal**: Remove the wheel to access the suspension components.

3. **Disconnect Components**: Depending on your vehicle, you may need to disconnect the sway bar, brake line bracket, and headlight sensor from the strut.

4. **Strut Mount Bolts**: Use the appropriate socket (often a 16mm) to remove all bolts securing the top of the strut to the strut tower.

5. **Support the Hub**: Place a jack under the suspension hub to support it once the strut is released.

6. **Remove Lower Mounting Bolt**: Use the appropriate socket (often an E18) to remove the bolt that secures the bottom of the strut to the wheel hub or knuckle.

7. **Release the Strut**: If the strut is held by a pinch bolt, you might need to use a pry bar in the slot where the strut sits in the knuckle to release the pinch load. Carefully pull the strut out of the knuckle.

8. **Lower the Jack**: Slowly lower the jack supporting the hub to allow the strut to clear the wheel well. Be cautious to ensure that nothing gets caught or overextended.

9. **Remove the Strut**: Once free from the vehicle, the strut can be removed completely.

10. **Installation of New Coilover**: If installing a new coilover, reverse these steps, ensuring all bolts are torqued to the manufacturer's specifications and all components are reconnected properly.

Always double-check that all connections are secure and that the suspension operates smoothly before driving.","suspension (unless it's camber plates) without changing the dampers.

2025-05-16 16:44:23,v1.1,What's the best way to wash my M2?,"The best way to wash your M2 involves a few careful steps to ensure the car's finish remains pristine:

1. **Pre-Rinse:** Start with a thorough rinse to remove loose dirt and debris, which minimizes the risk of scratching the paint during the wash process.

2. **Two-Bucket Method:** Use two buckets, one with a car wash soap solution and the other with clean water for rinsing your wash mitt. This method helps avoid transferring dirt back onto the car's surface.

3. **Wash Mitt:** Use a high-quality, clean microfiber wash mitt. Avoid brushes or sponges that can trap dirt and cause scratches.

4. **Washing:** Wash the car from the top down in sections, rinsing the mitt in the clean water bucket frequently to remove dirt before reloading it with soapy water.

5. **Rinse:** After washing, thoroughly rinse the car with clean water to remove all soap residues.

6. **Drying:** Dry the car with clean microfiber towels or a blower to prevent water spots. Avoid drying in direct sunlight.

7. **Additional Protection:** Consider applying a quality wax or ceramic coating for added protection and shine. This step also helps in easier cleaning and maintenance in the future.

8. **Wheel Care:** Use a dedicated wheel cleaner and brush to clean the wheels and avoid using the same wash mitt or water as used on the car's body to prevent cross-contamination.

9. **Undercarriage Cleaning:** If you're in an area with road salt, make sure to clean the undercarriage to prevent rust. Some prefer using a self-service car wash bay with a pressure washer for this purpose.

2025-05-16 16:48:15,v1.1,What's the spun crank hub issue and what causes it?,"The spun crank hub issue refers to a situation where the crank hub, which is a crucial component that connects the crankshaft to the timing chain and other engine components, slips or spins out of its intended position. This can disrupt the engine's timing and potentially lead to severe engine damage.

The primary causes of a crank hub spinning include:

1. **Abrupt RPM Changes:** Hard shifts or mis-shifts can cause sudden changes in RPM, exerting excessive force on the crank hub.
2. **High Engine Loads:** Modifications that increase engine power, such as tuning, can put additional strain on the timing system components (like the oil pump, camshafts, and high-pressure fuel pump), which are all connected via the crank hub.
3. **Ineffective Damping of Harmonics:** The engine produces vibrations and harmonics during operation. If these are not effectively damped, they can lead to the crank hub slipping.
4. **Engine Design and Assembly Factors:** Certain design or assembly issues can predispose the crank hub to slipping, such as inadequate clamping force between the hub and the crankshaft.

This issue is more commonly reported in engines subjected to high performance modifications or in scenarios involving aggressive driving styles that lead to the conditions mentioned above.","Curious if anyone has ever heard of a N55 crank hub spinning? Now that I am back in my og M2 I am contemplating doing some preventive maintenance, but I can't find anyone who has ever had an issue. Has anyone else heard anything?

1. **Assess Your Power Levels:** If your engine's power exceeds 500hp or if you frequently engage in high-performance driving, upgrading the crank hub is strongly recommended to prevent potential slipping.

2. **Choose the Right Kit:** Depending on your performance goals and budget, you can choose from different aftermarket crank hub kits. For moderate improvements, a single-piece non-pinned crank hub kit might suffice. However, for higher performance applications, a pinned crank hub kit offers more durability and security.

3. **Professional Installation:** Ensure that the crank hub kit is installed by a qualified technician. Proper installation is crucial to avoid any potential engine damage.

4. **Regular Maintenance and Checks:** Even after upgrading, regular maintenance and checks are essential to ensure everything is functioning correctly and to catch any potential issues early.

2025-05-16 16:54:10,v1.1,How do I perform the built-in bleeding procedure?,"To perform the built-in bleeding procedure on your BMW M2, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure the Cooling System is Assembled**: Before starting the bleeding process, make sure all components of the cooling system are properly assembled and there are no open connections.

2. **Remove the Bleeder Screw**: Locate and remove the bleeder screw on the expansion tank. This is crucial as it allows air to escape during the bleeding process.

3. **Fill the Expansion Tank**: Slowly fill the coolant into the expansion tank until coolant starts to come out of the bleeder screw hole. This indicates that the coolant level has reached the necessary height in the system.

4. **Run the Engine**: With the bleeder screw open and the coolant filled, start the engine. Allow it to run and reach its operating temperature. This helps in circulating the coolant and pushing out any air trapped in the system.

5. **Observe and Add Coolant**: As the engine runs, keep an eye on the level of coolant in the expansion tank. Add more coolant as needed to maintain the proper level. Watch for a steady stream of coolant coming out of the bleeder screw without air bubbles, which indicates that most of the air has been purged from the system.

6. **Close the Bleeder Screw**: Once you see a continuous stream of coolant without air bubbles, close the bleeder screw.

7. **Check and Top Off Coolant**: After closing the bleeder screw, check the coolant level in the expansion tank again. Top it off if necessary to ensure it's at the correct level according to the tank's markings.

8. **Inspect for Leaks**: Inspect the area around the bleeder screw and other parts of the cooling system for any signs of leaks.

9. **Test the System**: Allow the car to run for a while and monitor the temperature gauge to ensure that the engine is maintaining a normal operating temperature without overheating.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully bleed the cooling system of your BMW M2, ensuring efficient operation and preventing overheating issues.","off to the middle line - which is the thick seam on this car.Repeat these steps until the coolant level no longer drops and no additional coolant needs to be added after the bleed cycle has been run.b) Built in bleed procedure:- So for me personally I believe the built in bleed procedure can be done without vacuum bleeding, this is because the engine is tilted in such a way that all air bubbles will rise to the highest point in the loop which is the radiator outlet and will be siphoned off by th","then refil the reservoir, then pressing and lifting the pedal twice, then refilling etc. I think I probably did this about 30 times and it worked!

2025-05-16 17:02:51,v1.1,What are the details of the brake force lighting?,"Brake Force Display (BFD) is a feature on BMW vehicles that enhances the visibility of the car during hard braking by altering the behavior of the brake lights. In the US, the standard setting for BFD is ""area enlargement,"" where the rear fog lights, which are typically not used in the US, light up during forceful braking. However, many people choose to code this feature to make the brake lights flash instead, which is more noticeable.

If you want to change your BFD settings to have the brake lights flash (similar to the European style), you can do so using Bimmercode. Here are the steps and coding parameters:

1. **Brake Force Display (Flashing):**
   - Go to the FEM BODY module.
   - Change `ESS_AKTIVIERBARER_AUSGANG` to `bremslicht_blinkend`.

2. **Brake Lights Flashing (Instead of the rear fogs):**
   - Go to the REM module.
   - Change `MAPPING_BRAKEFORCED_L_OUTPUT` and `MAPPING_BRAKEFORCED_R_OUTPUT` to `bl`.

3. **Increasing the Flashing Rate (for LCI or LED bulbs only):**
   - Go to the REM module.
   - Change `ESS BLINKFREQ 1` and `ESS BLINKFREQ 2` to `05` or another higher number.

4. **Speed threshold at which BFD activates:**
   - Go to the FEM module.
   - It's set to `wert_02` (0x05) by default, but you can change it to `wert_01` (0x32) or `wert_03` (0x0A) for different thresholds.

These settings allow for customization of the Brake Force Display to suit your preferences and enhance safety by making your braking intentions more visible to other drivers.","I used Bimmercode to set up all the values in the FEM. Alas, it does not work.Any one else have success.

The idea of BrakeForceDisplay is it only activates when the ABS kicks in, for real aggressive braking. Think of your cell phone flying off the seat when you brake hard, something like that would activate it.Anything else would just annoy fellow motorist behind you and which I believe is illegal in most US states because brake lights have to remain steady burning, under DOT rules.If you want ","Display.

1. **Remove Rear Seats**: Removing the rear seats can save a significant amount of weight. One user noted a weight reduction by removing the rear seatbacks.

2. **Replace Front Seats**: Switching to lighter aftermarket seats can also help reduce weight. For instance, options like Recaro Podiums or RaceTech 4200 were mentioned as good choices for both comfort and weight savings.

3. **Lightweight Wheels**: Replacing the stock wheels with lighter options such as Forged APEX wheels can reduce rotational mass. This not only reduces overall weight but also improves handling and acceleration.

4. **Titanium Exhaust System**: Installing a titanium cat-back exhaust system can provide weight savings over the stock exhaust system.

5. **Brake System Upgrade**: Switching from steel brakes to ceramic brakes can save about 10 pounds per corner, significantly reducing unsprung weight.

6. **Carbon Fiber Components**: Consider using carbon fiber parts where possible, such as a rear seat delete kit in carbon fiber, to further reduce weight.

2025-05-17 00:21:11,v1.1,How do I enable video in motion?,"To enable video in motion on your M2, you can use coding tools like BimmerCode or E-Sys. Here are the steps you might follow:

1. **Backup Your Current Settings:** Always start by backing up your current vehicle coding settings. This is crucial in case you need to revert any changes.

2. **Using BimmerCode:**
   - Connect BimmerCode to your vehicle using a compatible OBD adapter.
   - Select the HU_NBT_EVO module (or similar, depending on your iDrive version).
   - Look for an option like `SPEEDLOCK_X_KMH` and set it to a high value like 255 km/h or disable it entirely.
   - Save the changes and exit. Test if video playback is available while the vehicle is in motion.

3. **Using E-Sys:**
   - Connect to your car using an ENET cable and launch E-Sys.
   - Load the HU_NBT_EVO module and look for parameters related to video in motion, such as `SPEEDLOCK_X_KMH`.
   - Modify the parameter to enable video playback at all speeds.
   - Save, write the changes to the car, and exit.

4. **Test the Functionality:** After coding, test the video in motion functionality to ensure it works as expected. Make sure to do this safely and ideally with a passenger, as watching video while driving can be distracting and unsafe.

Remember, while enabling video in motion can be useful for passengers, it's important to ensure that it does not distract the driver. Always prioritize safety while driving.","HiI've heard of video playback on older Idrive systems so I'm hoping nothing has changed with the M2.  Has anyone tried on the M2 yet?

2025-05-17 00:33:17,v1.1,How do I stream videos from USB?,"To stream videos from a USB on your M2, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your USB Drive:**
   - Format your USB drive to a compatible file system (FAT32 is commonly supported).
   - Copy the video files you want to play onto the USB drive. Ensure the video file format is supported by the iDrive system (common formats include MP4 and AVI).

2. **Insert the USB Drive:**
   - Plug the USB drive into the USB port in your M2. This is usually located in the center console or the glove compartment.

3. **Access Media Through iDrive:**
   - Use the iDrive controller to navigate to the ""Media"" or ""Media/Radio"" menu.
   - Select ""External devices,"" then choose the USB drive.
   - Browse through the files and select the video you want to play.

4. **Play the Video:**
   - The video should start playing on the iDrive screen. Remember, video playback might only be available while the vehicle is stationary, unless you have coded the system for video in motion.

These steps should help you enjoy video playback from a USB drive on your M2's iDrive system.","HiI've heard of video playback on older Idrive systems so I'm hoping nothing has changed with the M2.  Has anyone tried on the M2 yet?  I guess some coding might be required.Thanks for any tips

Fuel pump in the N55 tends to be the limitation to 400+ power.

Q for you... for HDPE do you really need 600hp on a 3k lb car?  Its not a straight course right? If you can get the n55 bear 500ish feels like it would suffice? Plus you could lightEn up the car a smidge.Granted you need to solve the fueling issue and possibly upgrade to a bigger turbo for reliability to get to the 500 range.

2025-05-17 18:20:03,v1.1,What’s the best m2 to buy OG or comp?,"Based on the discussions and experiences shared in the Bimmerpost F87 M2 forums, the choice between an OG M2 and an M2 Competition (M2C) depends on your priorities and how you intend to use the car.

If you are focused on track performance and potentially competing, the M2 Competition might be the better choice. It offers more power and better heat management, which is crucial for longer sessions on the track. The M2C's S55 engine is more capable of handling upgrades without suffering from heat issues compared to the OG M2's N55 engine.

However, if you value the driving experience and the balance and nimbleness of the car, the OG M2 provides a lot of joy and satisfaction, especially on tracks that are not power sensitive. It is also noted to be quite enjoyable and continues to be a rewarding car as you improve your driving skills.

Both models have their merits, and your personal preference for either performance or driving enjoyment will guide your choice.",than the comp.

2025-05-18 02:00:52,v1.1,I need the steps for installing front coilovers?,"To install front coilovers, follow these steps:

1. **Remove the existing front strut**: Use a spring compressor to safely compress the springs, removing the load from the upper strut mounts. Use an 18mm 12-point socket to completely remove the top strut nut from the upper strut mount. Carefully separate the top mounts, remembering the order in which all parts were removed.

2. **Replace components as needed**: You may now replace the springs, strut, or camber plates as required by your new setup.

3. **Assemble everything in reverse order**: When inserting the strut into the knuckle, ensure that the indexing pin aligns with the open slot where you previously inserted the pry bar.

4. **Install the coilover**: Place the KW spring on top of the coilover, aligning it to the spring edge as per the KW instructions. Install the OEM top mount onto the KW coilover and rubber OEM mount using a 22mm nut, which requires a pass-through socket to avoid turning. Torque this to 50 Nm.

5. **Insert the lower sleeve**: Take the lower sleeve (gold colored) and insert it into the pinch bolt mount, ensuring the opening is lined up. You may need to use a dead blow hammer to seat it properly.

6. **Slide the assembled coilover into the sleeve**: You may need to gently pry the joint open again to get it to fit. Ensure the knob on the coilover goes into the aligned slot.

7. **Rotate the coilover and hub back under the fender**: There should not be clearance problems as it is lower than OEM.

8. **Attach and torque bolts**: 
   - Install the 5 strut mounting bolts and torque each to 30 Nm.
   - Reconnect the upper strut bar and torque to 56 Nm.
   - Tighten (but do not torque) the pinch bolt. BMW manual recommends using a new bolt as it is one-time use.
   - Torque the new pinch bolt to 56 Nm once everything is seated properly.

9. **Reconnect the sway bar and torque to 28 Nm**.

10. **Final checks**: Ensure all brake line clips are back in place and reconnect the headlight sensor.

11. **Adjust ride height**: Measure from the center of the pinch bolt hole to where springs seat on the collar and set to your desired ride height. Verify this measurement twice and write it down.

12. **Re-index bushings if necessary**: Refer to specific instructions for re-indexing bushings.

As discussed in the forum, stock HPFPs can struggle with maintaining the necessary pressure, especially on higher octane or ethanol-blended fuels. Upgrading to a more robust HPFP, such as the Dorch Stage 2, can help ensure consistent fuel delivery, supporting higher power outputs and more aggressive tuning setups. This upgrade is particularly beneficial if you're also considering other modifications that increase fuel demand.","All right yall, time to upgrade something we all often overlook in our big power builds.  That is the low pressure fuel pump, or LPFP which often can struggle at higher HP tunes.As we tune higher and higher, stage 2 and beyond, big turbos and *especially* E85, your LPFP can badly lag behind.

2025-05-17 22:18:37,v1.1,Which turbo upgrades are recommended for the N55 engine  in the M2?,"For the N55 engine in the M2, there are several turbo upgrade options available, categorized into three stages:

1. **Stage 1: Hybrid Turbo** - This involves using the stock housing with an upgraded compressor wheel. It offers a similar spool to the stock turbo but provides more headroom at higher RPMs, with an estimated gain of 40-75hp. This option is suitable if you want a boost in power without significant changes to the turbo's response characteristics.

2. **Stage 2: Hybrid Turbo** - This upgrade uses the stock housing but includes larger upgraded compressor and turbine wheels. It typically introduces a slight delay in turbo spool (lag) ranging from 300-700rpm but delivers much better power up to the redline, with an estimated gain of 100-150hp. This stage is ideal for those looking for a noticeable increase in power over Stage 1 while still maintaining a relatively stock appearance.

3. **Stage 3: Complete Turbo Replacement** - This is the most extensive upgrade, involving a completely new turbo and manifold. Many kits are designed for other N55 applications and might require fabrication to fit onto the M2. These kits usually include a ball bearing turbo that provides quick spool and a significantly higher overall horsepower potential, with gains ranging from 150-400hp depending on the turbo selection. This stage is recommended for enthusiasts seeking the highest possible performance and who are willing to undertake more complex installations.

Each of these stages has different implications in terms of cost, installation complexity, and the impact on the car's driving characteristics. It's important to consider these factors along with your performance goals and budget when choosing a turbo upgrade.","With so little information on our forum regarding all of the different turbo upgrade options available, enthusiasts may not recognize the many options available for the N55 M2.

2. **Detach the Stock Turbo**: Unlike a full turbo assembly replacement, for the Pure500, you only need to detach the stock turbo from its exhaust manifold. This means you do not have to remove the entire stock turbo assembly.

3. **Install the Pure500 Turbo**: Once the stock turbo is detached, the Pure500 turbo can be dropped in its place, aligning it with the existing connections and mounts.

4. **Reattach Connections**: Reconnect any hoses, pipes, and electrical connections to the new Pure500 turbo. Ensure all fittings are secure to prevent leaks or loose connections.

5. **Reassemble Removed Components**: Replace any components that were removed to access the turbo area.

6. **Check and Test**: Once everything is reassembled, it’s important to check for any leaks or unusual noises. It is recommended to perform a test drive to ensure the turbo is functioning correctly and to monitor the vehicle’s performance.

However, a few turbo options were discussed that could potentially meet your goals:

1. **Pure Stage 2 Turbo** - This turbo, in combination with full bolt-ons (FBO) and a tune (like BM3), is suggested by users. However, the limitation of 91 octane might restrict you to lower power outputs closer to 430-440whp rather than the target 450whp.

2. **TTE460 Turbo** - This turbo is mentioned as capable of achieving around 460whp, but that's likely on higher octane fuels. On 91ACN, you might see slightly lower numbers, but it could be closer to your target compared to others.

3. **Pure500 Turbo** - Another option from Pure Turbos that is noted for spooling as fast as stock and providing reliable power. On a custom tune with 91 octane, it might get close to your goal, especially if combined with other modifications like a high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP).

Adding a water-methanol injection (WMI) kit was also suggested as a way to help reach higher power levels on 91 octane by effectively increasing the fuel's octane rating and cooling the intake air.

In summary, the Pure Stage 2 or TTE460 could be viable options, but consider the addition of a WMI kit to help overcome the limitations of 91ACN octane fuel.","m not big on ethanol personally, but I use it since I can mix blends or run a full tank and the ECUtek software I use can self adjust without issues or map switching.Ive seen a Pure stage 2 put down 420whp on a FBO set up with a high flow cat.

You'll need a decent size turbo, and all the breathing mods - inlet, intake, downpipe - and I would even recommend MILVS (mine appear to have 20-30whp peak ","tdocAs said earlier, you will only want to do it with bigger turbo or meth (octane & fueling). But if you have access to AKI94-95 (RON99-100), the custom tuning definitely can extract 20-30hp more for you.But, there is always an octane/IAT point passing which you lose power. Without hardware upgrade (like turbo), the more boost you have, the sooner you will get to that point. That's how less consistency is defined.","Currently stock, looking for ~450whp.. looking for recommendations on what turbo could help me achieve that.I was thinking the pure stage 2 setup with fbo and bm3 tune? 91acn is pretty bad fuel but thats all we have.Photo of my 16 LBB Manual on the Cabot trail, first road trip in the car 🙂

The Dorch Stage 2 pump is mentioned as a good upgrade for handling higher fuel demands without any disadvantages other than cost.

2. **Disassemble the Spring Hat**: If your setup includes a spring hat (the red part mentioned in one of the posts), you may need to remove it. This can be challenging if it's seized; consider using penetrating oil and a deadblow hammer to gently tap it loose.

3. **Place the Thrust Sheet**: Once the spring hat is removed or loosened, place the Swift thrust sheet between the spring hat and the top of the spring. Ensure it's centered and lies flat to provide smooth movement.

4. **Reassemble the Spring Assembly**: Place the spring hat back on top of the spring, ensuring the thrust sheet remains in position. Reassemble the rest of the spring assembly back into the vehicle.

5. **Reinstall the Spring Assembly**: Carefully compress the spring and reinstall the top mounts. Ensure everything is tightened to the manufacturer's specifications to avoid any loose components.

6. **Test the Assembly**: Once everything is reassembled, it's a good idea to test the vehicle at low speeds in a safe area to ensure there are no unusual noises or movements from the new installation.

These steps are general guidelines. Always refer to specific instructions provided with your Swift thrust sheets or consult a professional mechanic to ensure proper installation.","What size swift thrust sheets for our cars? They come in 2.37"" 2.56"" and 2.76""

2025-05-18 21:47:32,v1.1max-token400-overlay50text-embedding-3-smallgpt-4-turbo,Which is better and why? Og M2 or m2 comp?,"The choice between the OG M2 and the M2 Competition (M2C) depends largely on what you value in a car and how you plan to use it.

**Performance and Handling:**
- The M2C generally offers better performance due to its S55 engine, which is more powerful than the N55 engine in the OG M2. This makes the M2C faster on the track.
- In terms of handling, the M2C has been described as feeling more ""planted"" and less jumpy compared to the OG M2, thanks to its re-tuned suspension and additional bracing from the M3/M4 models. The M2C also features different alignment settings and updated EPS software, contributing to a more stable and neutral handling experience.

**Reliability and Cooling:**
- The M2C might be more reliable, especially in scenarios requiring sustained performance, such as longer track sessions. This is due to better cooling capabilities compared to the OG M2.

**Enjoyment and Driving Experience:**
- Enjoyment is subjective. The OG M2 is praised for its nimbleness and balance, making it a joy to drive, especially on tracks that are not power sensitive. However, the M2C's ability to handle added power without compromising heat management is a significant advantage if you're looking to compete or frequently drive in hot climates.

**Cost and Practical Considerations:**
- The OG M2 is generally cheaper, which could be a deciding factor if budget is a concern. The cost difference between upgrading to an M2C from an OG M2 might not justify the performance gains depending on your specific use case and how much you value the incremental improvements in handling and power.

In summary, if you prioritize top-notch performance, better handling, and are considering track competitiveness or driving in hotter climates, the M2C might be the better choice. However, if you are looking for a balance of enjoyable driving dynamics and cost-effectiveness, the OG M2 remains a compelling option.",".

2025-05-19 03:38:36,v1.1max-token400-overlay50text-embedding-3-smallgpt-4-turbo,How to drift,"To learn how to drift effectively, especially with a car like the M2, it's essential to gain practical experience in a controlled environment such as a skidpad or during HPDE (High Performance Driver Education) days. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Skidpad Training**: This is crucial as it allows you to experience and handle the car in a controlled slide. The skidpad provides a safe environment to practice and understand how your car behaves when it loses traction.

2. **Tire Selection**: Choose tires that provide a balance between grip and the ability to break traction smoothly. Some users suggest using ultra-high performance or even all-season tires for easier initiation of drifts due to their reduced grip compared to maximum performance summer tires.

3. **Vehicle Setup**: Adjustments like tire pressure and alignment can significantly affect the car's drift capability. For instance, setting a higher tire pressure in the rear can help in reducing grip slightly, making it easier to initiate a drift.

4. **Driving Technique**: When you start to drift, it's important to react quickly. As soon as you feel the rear of the car sliding, you should countersteer and adjust your throttle input to maintain the drift without spinning out. Practicing these reactions in a skidpad setting helps develop the necessary muscle memory.

5. **Safety and Control**: Initially, keep the traction control on (like DTC or MDM modes) until you are more confident in your car control skills. This helps prevent total loss of control as you're learning.

6. **Practice and Patience**: Drifting requires a lot of practice. It's about refining your reactions and understanding how changes in steering, throttle, and brake affect the car during a drift.

Remember, the key to mastering drifting is consistent practice in a safe, controlled environment where you can learn from each attempt without the risk of damaging your vehicle or compromising safety.","where they have a skidpad, if possible.  And probably a few HPDE days, but the skidpad time is key;  really no good places to learn this on the street unless you live in the snowbelt.  All the talking and thinking in the world can't make up for the actual experience of doing it.  And don't turn off DTC, even to use MDM, until you feel you have a handle on this.

you specifically want less grip for ease of drifting, so I'd say pick a tire from the ""ultra high performance"" category rather than ""max performance summer.""an all-season will probably break away more easily than a summer tire too.you could also go down to a narrower wheel in the rear, again, less width = less grip = easier to start a drift.

Anything catastrophic ? ,"Leaking differential seals, while not immediately catastrophic, can lead to more serious issues if not addressed. The primary concern is the potential loss of differential fluid, which is crucial for the proper lubrication and cooling of the differential gears. Over time, low fluid levels can cause the gears to wear prematurely or overheat, potentially leading to differential failure. Additionally, consistent leaking can attract dirt and debris, which might contaminate the differential fluid and further accelerate wear on the components.

It's generally advisable to fix leaks early to prevent these more significant problems. Some users have noted that while slight seepage or ""sweating"" might be considered normal by some standards, actual dripping or noticeable leakage should be addressed promptly to maintain the integrity and performance of the vehicle.","Attached are screenshots from a video I took.Hey guys, I noticed when I was doing my oil change that my axle is leaking at the point where it meets the diff.

1. **Prepare the Area and Vehicle:**
   - Place blue painters tape on the fender edge to protect it.
   - Jack up the car and secure it on jack stands. Ensure the car is stable before you start working.

2. **Disconnect Necessary Components:**
   - Remove the dust cover and plastic shroud around the strut area.
   - Disconnect the headlight sensor (driver side only) where it connects to the control arm using a 2x 10mm wrench.
   - Disconnect the brake pad sensor and other wires from their plastic connections so they hang freely.

3. **Support the Suspension:**
   - Support the ball joint with a jack under very light tension to prevent any undue stress on the suspension components.

4. **Remove Strut Components:**
   - Remove the pinch bolt from the strut using a 16mm bolt and nut.
   - Remove the strut bar bolt from the upper strut mount using an E18 socket.
   - Remove the 5 strut mounting bolts using a 16mm socket.

5. **Lower the Strut:**
   - Slowly lower the jack supporting the suspension until the top of the strut clears the wheel well. Be careful to ensure that nothing gets caught or overextended.
   - Pivot the strut out of the wheel well.

6. **Remove the Strut from the Knuckle:**
   - Place a pry bar in the open slot where the strut sits in the knuckle and apply leverage to release the “pinch load” from the strut. Pull the strut out of the knuckle while doing this.

7. **Compress the Spring:**
   - Before removing the top hat, compress the spring using spring compressors.
   - Use an 18mm passthrough socket and a 10mm socket to loosen the top hat. Be careful not to damage the paper gasket during this process.

8. **Remove the Strut Assembly:**
   - Once the top hat is loosened, the strut assembly should be free to remove. Be cautious during this step to avoid any damage or injury.

9. **Repeat for the Other Side:**
   - Repeat the above steps for the other side of the vehicle to ensure both front struts and springs are removed.

These steps should help you safely remove the front struts and springs from your M2.

Look under it, there is a gap just for a pry tool. Theres a few more screws.  Theres 2 more screws under the door card.  Once theyre removed you must pry the card off.  Youll hear the clips pop.  Once thats done, just undo the wiring clips and then slide the speaker housing off the speaker.  Then you can pull the speaker off and reveal the 3 t30's holding the mirror on.

Ive read that it has been done but requires some fabrication. Can anyone tell me what type of fabrication it requires or if its even worth to try to retrofit M3/4 mirrors or if I should keep looking for M2C mirrors?Thanks in advance!

You would have to fabricate the black triangular piece that connects the mirror frame to the door of the car. That's t","Do your mirror squeak when you fold them in?Have you talked to your service department about it?Have they acknowledged that they squeak and replaced them?

However, the posts do discuss various exhaust systems and their features, including issues with valves sticking or needing adjustment, but none specifically address the issue of snapping valve springs.","QuickSilver is one of the best-known exhaust brands out there, and theyre best known for their high build quality. One of the biggest problems with choosing an aftermarket exhaust system for your car is finding something that isnt too loud and isnt too quiet. Luckily, this exhaust system from QuickSilver doesnt have this issue thanks to its valved muffler. With a valved muffler, your car will be quiet when you need it and loud when you want it. Being able to keep your car quiet during early ","Hi,I'm offered a used Akrapovic exhaust (without the downpipe). Seller says that the only issue is that when starting up the engine in comfort more, the valve is momentarily stuck, and almost immediately released with a press of the gas pedal. He says that it is a known issue with the Akrapovic exhaust valve after some time, and some grease on the valve should release it...?Does anyone know?Also, does the Akrapovic exhast use the OEM solenoid? cause I just replaced it...so if it's using the same","sound good to you.I personally think there are better options aftermarket

M Performance Exhaust all the way! Well worth every penny. Also under warranty.

If the ""valves open"" position equates to a straight through exhaust (I'd like confirmation on this), then would it be correct to think that, for those who want noise ALL the time, one might as well buy a straight-through exhaust with no muffler, no complicated switches, much lighter and half the price ? Or am I missing something ?

I like the dual exit design as I think it gives the car a better sound up top. Turner seemed to fit the bill - valved, dual exit, high quality.

There is some adjustment you can do simply due to the nature of the design with the interlocking pipes, which ensures you can get a good fit.  The tips all connect individually, and look fantastic from behind.  They are around 4"" and make the rear end look a lot more aggressive.  Also, like the rest of the system, they are clamped on individually and can be adjusted to sit further out or tucked into the diffuser.  I chose to position them just a hair p"
